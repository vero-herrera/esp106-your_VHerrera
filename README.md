These are my lab submissions. They can also be found on the course Canvas.

Lab 5 scripts run successfully. However, for the last block of script, I recieve pop ups stating:
      " Updating Loaded Packages
      One or more of the packages that will be updated by this installation are currently loaded. Restarting R prior to upadting these packages is strongly recommended. 
      R studio can restart R and then automatically continue the installation after restarting (all work and data will be preserved during the restart). 
      Do you want to restart R prior to installing?"
 The IDE remains stuck in a loop going over this message. It does not affect the results of my scripts and I can just click cancel. However, I know this is not best practice for a clean R file.
